# GPUJPEG Examples

Examples in this directory represent very simple **GPUJPEG** library usage
demonstration.  Please keep in mind that this doesn't represent a typical
use-case for GPUJPEG, which is suitable rather for processing a _huge amount_
of pictures in a batch (or for a really big picture) to provide best performance.

Also only a minimal subset of options is used for simplicity. The samples are
intended just as a quick introduction of the library. For more complex use
please look into a more bulky _console application_ ([main.c](../src/main.c))
or directly into headers in [libgpujpeg](../libgpujpeg) subdirectory.
